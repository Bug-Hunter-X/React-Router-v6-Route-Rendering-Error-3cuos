# React Router v6 Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: routes failing to render their associated components correctly, often resulting in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')` error.

The bug is present in `bug.js`. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Bug Description

The main issue is that while the home route (`/`) renders correctly, attempts to navigate to other routes such as `/about` leads to an error. This is because a component is improperly used in the route or there's an issue with how the routes are defined.
